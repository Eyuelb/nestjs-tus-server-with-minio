> Nestjs tus-server with MinIO SW3-Store is a powerful combination of technologies for building a scalable and high-performance file upload and storage system.

This project leverages the following libraries:

- **NestJS:** A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It's a great choice for creating your API endpoints and managing server logic.

- **tus-server:** A server implementation of the Tus Protocol, which is a popular open protocol for resumable file uploads. With tus-server, you can handle large file uploads efficiently and reliably.

- **MinIO SW3-Store:** MinIO is a high-performance distributed object storage server, and SW3-Store is a MinIO storage adapter for tus-server. This combination enables you to store and manage uploaded files in a highly scalable and fault-tolerant manner, making it suitable for handling large amounts of data.

This project provides a robust foundation for your file upload and storage needs, ensuring a seamless experience for both developers and end users.
